# Batch Image Processing for InstantID Generation

## Overview
The `preprocess.py` module significantly enhances the usability of the `app.py` InstantID generation tool by enabling batch processing of images. With this module, users can now apply various styles and settings to multiple images, streamlining the process of creating stylized, identity-preserving versions of a provided dataset.

## Features
- **Batch Processing:** Process numerous images in one go without the need for repeated manual interventions.
- **Diverse Stylization:** Automatically applies a range of styles to each image, with options for randomness or preset selections.
- **Adjustable Settings:** Each image can be augmented with a different set of parameters, including strength ratios, number of inference steps, and guidance scales.
- **Resize and Padding:** Images are automatically resized and padded to maintain consistent dimensions across the batch.
- **Loop Through Styles:** Optionally configure the script to loop through available styles, ensuring a variety of outputs.
- **Efficient Logging:** Progress and results are logged to a CSV file for easy tracking and auditing.

## Quick Start

1. Place your images in the `sample_images` folder.
2. Configure your desired settings within `preprocess.py`.
3. Run `preprocess.py` to process all images in the folder using the InstantID model.
4. Processed images and logs will be saved to `generated_images` and `generation_log.csv` respectively.

## Configuration Variables

Here's a quick rundown of key configuration variables:

```python
INPUT_FOLDER_NAME = 'sample_images'
OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME = 'generated_images'
LOG_FILENAME = 'generation_log.csv'
STYLES = [style["name"] for style in style_list]
USE_RANDOM_STYLE = False
NUMBER_OF_LOOPS = 1
...
```

Adjust these settings based on your requirements before executing the script.

## How It Works

`preprocess.py` imports `generate_image` from `app.py` and uses it as the core function to apply InstantID's identity-preserving features to each image in the specified input folder. It handles the batching, resizing, padding, and logging that `app.py` could not originally perform on its own.

### Key Functions
- `resize_and_pad_image`: Standardizes all images to uniform dimensions.
- `log_to_csv`: Records the processing results for each image.
- `initial_image`: Orchestrates the image preprocessing and logging workflow.

### Execution

To start processing, just invoke the `initial_image` function:

```python
from preprocess import initial_image, generate_image
initial_image(generate_image)
```

## Footnotes

### Origin
This module is an addition to the initially single image-based `app.py` script for InstantID: a cutting-edge, zero-shot identity-preserving generation tool developed by the InstantX Team at Xiaohongshu Inc. The tool supports various generative tasks and can customize personal face images with styles and prompts.

### How `app.py` Works
`app.py` allows users to upload a face image, optionally add a pose image, enter a text prompt, apply styles, and generate an identity-preserved output image using the InstantID pipeline. However, the original script lacked batch processing capabilities, which is where `preprocess.py` comes into play.
